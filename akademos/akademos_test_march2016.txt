1. PHP

Instructions:
Here we have a function that help us spam our hearty laughter. 

function spam($number){
  //TODO: Not returning the expected value.
  return "hue" * number;
}

But it's not working! We need you to fix it:

Expected results:
spam(1);//hue
spam(6);//huehuehuehuehuehue
spam(14);//huehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehue

Your Solution:

function spam($number){
  return "hue" * number; //TODO: Rewrite to make the function work
}

2. PHP & JavaScript

Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.

Example

solution('camelCasing') should return 'camel Casing'

Your Solution:

// complete the function, PHP
function solution($string) {
  //...    
}

// complete the function,JavaScript
function solution(string) {
  //...    
}

3. JavaScript

Description:

It's time to create an autocomplete function! Yay!

The autocomplete function will take in an input string and a dictionary array and return 
the values from the dictionary that start with the input string. If there are more than 5 matches, 
restrict your output to the first 5 results. If there are no matches, return an empty array.

Example:

autocomplete('ai', ['airplane','airport','apple','ball']) = ['airplane','airport']
The dictionary will always be a valid array of strings. Please return all results in the order 
given in the dictionary, even if they're not always alphabetical. The search should NOT be case 
sensitive, but the case of the word should be preserved when it's returned.

For example, "Apple" and "airport" would both return for an input of 'a'. However, they should 
return as "Apple" and "airport" in their original cases.

Important note: Any input that is NOT a letter should be treated as if it is not there. 
For example, an input of "$%^" should be treated as "" and an input of "ab*&1cd" should be treated as "abcd".

Your Solution:

// complete the function, JavaScript
function autocomplete(input, dictionary){
  //...  
}

4. PHP

Description:

In elementary arithmetic a "carry" is a digit that is transferred from one column of digits 
to another column of more significant digits during a calculation algorithm.

This is about determining the number of carries performed during the addition of multi-digit numbers.

You will receive an input string containing a set of pairs of numbers formatted as follows:

123 456
555 555
123 594

And your output should be a string formatted as follows:

No carry operation
3 carry operations
1 carry operations
Some Assumptions

Assume that numbers can be of any length.
But both numbers in the pair will be of the same length.
Although not all the numbers in the set need to be of the same length.
If a number is shorter, it will be zero-padded.
The input may contain any arbitrary number of pairs.

Your Solution:

// complete the function, PHP
function solve($input){
  return "";
}


5. JavaScript

Description:

Write a functions that will make basic math calculations to produce results like in the following example. Please, do not use "eval":

three(times(five())); // must return 15
four(plus(eight())); // must return 12
eight(minus(two())); // must return 6
six(dividedBy(three())); // must return 2

Your Solution (you can change the template whatever you want):

function zero(x) {}
function one(x)  {}
function two(x)  {}
function three(x)  {}
function four(x)  {}
function five(x)  {}
function six(x)  {}
function seven(x)  {}
function eight(x)  {}
function nine(x)  {}

function plus(x) {}
function minus(x) {}
function times(x) {}
function dividedBy(x) {}

function checkCalculations() {
	console.log(three(times(five())));
	console.log(four(plus(eight())));
	console.log(eight(minus(two())));
	console.log(six(dividedBy(three())));
}


6. SQL

We have two tables.

Table: department
Fields:
id Number (pk)
name Varchar(100)

Table: employee
Fields:
id Number (pk)
department_id Number
chief_id Number
name Varchar(100)
salary Number

Please write SQL queries for:

- Display a list of employees, who receive salary greater than the direct supervisor's salary
- Display a list of employees, who receive the maximum salary in his department
- Display a list of employees, who have no subordinates working in the same department
- Display a list of departments sorted by total salary of employees in it, descending
