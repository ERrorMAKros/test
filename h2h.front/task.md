Task requirements
Create simple list of products and form for saving new product info on server. Please,
use this open source fake server REST-API for back-end:
- https://www.onlinetool.in/fake-rest-api
 General requirements:
- use one of the following frameworks (libs): Ember.js (v3.x) or React.js (v 16.0),
prefered Ember.js
- be free not to use ember-data or redux.js (but of course use them if you want)
- use google materialize style guide for task project
https://material.io/design/guidelines-overview/
- your task projects source should be uploaded on your GIT-hub account**
Task requirements:
- <Form/> for saving new product:
- with two inputs: ‘homepage’, ‘description’
- with client side validation for data submitting (validate empty value in inputs)
- with saving user inputs on server side
- with refreshing products list after success saving on server side with new
product
- <List/> of products
- get the list from server side and render it
GOOD LUCK!


Fake REST-API returns only default list of existing products, to update it and render on client side use
server response on saving new product to add this response into existing products list.

If you haven’t GIT-hub account we recommend you to create it (we believe it’s something like ‘must
have’ for ‘cool developers’ :) )
